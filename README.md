# OOPS-JAVASCRIPT

### WHAT IS OOP ?

Ans : OOP(Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm, which is used to organize our code into Objects and Classes.

Four Pillars of OOP(Object Oriented Programming) :

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

#### ABSTRACTION :

> An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

- Points to Remember :

1. We cannot create an instance of Abstract Class.
2. It reduces the duplication of code.

#### ENCAPSULATION :

> OOPs restrict direct access to its methods and variables by encapsulating the code and data together. In javascript, the data binds with the functions acting on that data in the process of achieving encapsulation in order to control the data and validate it.

#### INHERITANCE :

> Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.To use class inheritance, you use the extends keyword.

#### POLYMORPHISM :

> The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.
